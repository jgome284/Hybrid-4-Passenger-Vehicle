## Acknowledgements
The final report is compiled with minor contributions from Harris Pardesi, Justin Boone, and Madhu Scherba. Special thanks go out to Mrs. Taylor Schultz for major contributions in the physical architecture. My contributions to the final report include our mission scenarios, context diagram, and functional architecture. The Cameo model in this repo, including diagrams hosted in the images container were developed by myself and reflect no support from the team. The Engine Heat Stress Test and risk mitigation strategy for Regenerative Brake Management are also my own contributions.
